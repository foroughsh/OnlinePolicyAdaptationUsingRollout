# Emulation of the client population

To emulate the client population, we use a load generator that is developed for our work. This component can generate different statistical or custom load patterns. 
In this work, we use a periodic load pattern generated by a Poisson process modulated by the sin function. We run two instances of this load generator that emulate two groups of clients 
(premium and freemium users).
The configuration of these load generators is presented in Table \ref{tab:LG_config}. 
$P_{S}$ shows the starting point of the average number of requests per second and $P_{A}$ shows the amplitude of the sinusoidal function. T shows the period of the function in seconds. 

The load generator has two main parts, the part that generates the event timestamps and the second that sends the events at specified time. Figure \ref{fig:LG_load_pattern} shows the generated 
load based on the stochastic process and request rate generated by the load generator.
